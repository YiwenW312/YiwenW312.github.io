                <p class="intro">
                    Hello! I'm Emelina (Yiwen) Wang, a software engineer with a unique blend of legal expertise and technical
                    skills. I grew up in Shanghai, China, and moved to Seattle, WA, to pursue a Ph.D. in Law at the University
                    of Washington. During my legal studies, I rediscovered my passion for technology, leading me to pursue a
                    Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Seattle.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    With experience in both legal and software development roles, I approach problems from multiple
                    perspectives, ensuring innovative and compliant solutions. I founded Tech@Crossroads, a student organization
                    that encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, merging my legal and technical backgrounds. Our projects
                    bridge the gap between tech and non-tech students, fostering innovation and shared learning.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    As a problem solver, quick learner, and team player, I am eager to grow and make an impact in a Software
                    Engineer position. My diverse skills and experiences make me a versatile and valuable asset in the software
                    engineering field.
